# Installation & First steps

**NOTE**: this is just a prototype, *do not* use in production.

## Core installation

Pick your preferred distribution between Fedora 34+ and Debian 11, install
it and make sure it's up to date. Also ensure that the system firewall is
not blocking any connection.

Start the installation procedure as `root`:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/main/core/install.sh | bash
```

At the end of the install script the UI is available at
`https://<server_ip_or_fqdn>/cluster-admin/`:

- default user: `admin`
- default password: `Nethesis,1234`

Some configuration tasks can be completed also by invoking additional
commands: follow on-screen instructions printed by `install.sh`.

Run either new cluster initialization (`create-cluster`) or joining an existing cluster (`join-cluster`).

## Install a development branch

Developers may prefer to run `install.sh` with one or more images from a
development branch. The first argument selects the branch name, following
arguments the module names to be pulled from that branch.

    bash install.sh mybranch module1 module2 ...

## Core applications

Core applications installed by default:
- [Traefik](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/traefik/README.md) -- see how to request a Let's Encrypt [certificate for the FQDN](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/traefik/README.md#set-certificate)
- [Loki](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/loki/REDME.md) (only on the leader node)
- [Promtail](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/promtail/README.md)
- [LDAP proxy](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/ldapproxy/README.md)

Available core applications:
- [Netdata](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/netdata/README.md)
- [Samba](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/samba/README.md)


## Application installation

To install an instance of an available application use:
```
add-module <module> <node_id>
```
The  above command will try to install the latest stable version of the module.

Example to install Dokuwiki on node 1:
```
add-module dokuwiki 1
```

You can also install an image which is not still available inside the repository by using
its URL.

Example to install Dokuwiki directly from the image registry:
```
add-module ghrc.io/nethserver/dokuwiki:mydev 1
```

Many applications need a configuration step after install, for more info, 
please refer to the README of each application.

Available applications:

- [Dokuwiki](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/dokuwiki/README.md)
- [Nextcloud](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/nextcloud/README.md)
- [Mail](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-scratchpad/blob/main/netdata/README.md)

## Uninstall

The `uninstall.sh` script attempts to stop and erase core components and
additional modules. Handle it with care because it erases everything under `/home/*` and `/var/lib/nethserver/*`!

    bash /var/lib/nethserver/node/uninstall.sh
