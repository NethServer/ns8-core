## NS8 updates

Core updates include enhancements and bug fixes for the `core` image. Such image contains: agents, UI and common actions.

To execute the core update, use:

    api-cli run update-core --data '{"core_url":"ghcr.io/nethserver/core:latest","nodes":[1, 2]}

The cluster agent forwards the request to selected nodes.
Each node agent downloads the new image and restart core services: agents, redis and api-server.
The core services restart occurs only if the core version update has at least a minor release increment.

The following applications are part of the core but can be updated as normal modules:

- ldapproxy
- traefik
- samba
- loki
- promtail

See [module updates]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/updates) for more info.
