# Events

Events are messages published on specific Redis channels. Modules must
subscribe to the channel they want to be notified from. Usually channel
address is under a module name, something like
`module/<module_id>/event/<event_name>`.

Events should respect the following rules:
- use past tense inside the name, like `account-provider-credentials-updated`
- accept a parameter in JSON format
- the parameter should contain minimal required info about the event
- optionally, the parameter can contain extra data which can ease the event usage

Well known events:
- `account-provider-changed`: the event should be fired by account providers to inform about configuration changes
- `account-provider-credentials-updated`: the event can be fired by account providers or LDAP proxies,
  it notifies the change of LDAP credentials (eg. `ldapservice` user) to applications

Events fired by the `cluster` agent (i.e. channel is `cluster/event/<event name>`):
- `module-added`: the event is fired at the end of the add-module process to inform other modules that a new module has been installed on the cluster
- `module-removed`: the event is fired at the end of the remove-module process to inform other modules that a module has been removed on the cluster

## Signaling events

To signal an event, just [PUBLISH](https://redis.io/commands/PUBLISH) a message to the channel.
All events take a JSON object as a parameter.

Example:
```
redis-cli PUBLISH module/traefik1/event/test '{"field": "value"}'
```

## Handling events

Events are handled like actions by the `agent` service.

Modules can define their event handlers under a dedicated directory,
separate from the `actions/` one: `${AGENT_INSTALL_DIR}/events/`. The
handler directory contains one or more step scripts that must be
executable files. For instance:
- **rootfull module**: `/var/lib/nethserver/mymodule/events/some-event-happened/10handler`.
- **rootless module**: `/home/mymodule/.config/events/some-event-happened/10handler`

Like actions, the event payload can be read by the step scripts from the
standard input file descriptor.

Lines sent to standard error and standard output are relayed to the system
log.

Similarly to actions, if an handler step exit code is non-zero, the
handler execution is aborted. Subsequent steps are not executed and an
error message is sent to the log.
