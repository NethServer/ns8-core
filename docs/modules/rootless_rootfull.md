# Rootless vs Rootfull

In the Podman world, non-privileged users can run containers on their own:
those are the so-called *rootless* containers.  In NethServer 8, we borrow
the same word from Podman and use it in the context of modules, together
with its opposite, *rootfull*.

To inspect and modify a rootless module start a SSH session. SSH is
preferred to `su - <user>` because the latter does not properly initialize
the Systemd session environment. For instance, to check if Traefik is running:

    ssh traefik1@localhost
    systemctl --user status

Let's see the differences of rootless modules vs rootfull modules.

## Unix user

The main difference between *rootless* and *rootfull* modules, as
suggested by the adjective, is the Unix user running the module processes
and its system privileges.

**Rootfull**: module containers run as `root` (EUID 0).

**Rootless**: module containers run as a normal Unix user. The Unix user account is
created by the node agent when the module instance is added. It has
session lingering enabled: it automatically starts a persistent Systemd
user manager instance at system boot.

To check if a module is rootless or not, in Python write:

```python
import os
if os.geteuid() == 0:
    print('ROOTFULL')
else:
    print('ROOTLESS')
```

Same thing, in Bash:

```bash
if [[ $EUID == 0 ]]; then
    echo ROOTFULL
else
    echo ROOTLESS
fi
```

As alternative print the effective user ID with

    id -u

## Filesystem paths

The two types of modules have a similar filesystem structure. Rootless
modules are installed to `/home/<module_id>/.config`, whilst rootfull are
installed to `/var/lib/nethserver/<module_id>`.

## Systemd units

Rootless modules also have Systemd user units installed under
`~/.config/systemd/user`. Recall that some system-wide user units are
installed by the core under `/etc/systemd/user`. When running the
`systemctl` command, add the `--user` flag. Eg.

    systemctl --user status traefik

Rootfull modules share the system-wide Systemd directories. Their units
are installed under `/etc/systemd/system`. As they share the same
directory, unit files must be named as `<module_id>` or they must use the
`<module_id>-` prefix to avoid naming clashes with other instances of the
same module. Eg:

    cat /etc/systemd/system/samba1.service
    systemctl start samba1

## Volumes

Rootfull modules share the same Podman volumes namspace. As consequence,
rootfull modules must use the `<module_id>-` prefix for their volume names
to avoid volume naming clashes. Eg.

    samba1-data
    samba1-config

Rootless modules can use any volume name because the Podman volume
namespace is private for the module.

This command prints out the filesystem path where Podman stores volumes
data:

    podman system info --format='{{.Store.VolumePath}}'
