# Find the images that are no longer required:
# 1. generate a sorted list starting with the old module image ID,
#    followed by its additional images, as declared by the
#    org.nethserver.images label
# 2. similarly, generate the list for the new image ID
# 3. compare (diff) the lists and extract the images that are no longer
#    required
# 4. pass them to `podman rmi`
